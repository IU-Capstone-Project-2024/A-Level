• Motivation is the reason for people's actions, willingness and goals.
• Ferrero regards its employees as part of the family who contribute to the growth of the business. This may create a sense of belonging and lead to Ferrero retaining the best employees.
• Every employee is inspired to innovate, starting from the first day they join. This will motivate workers to be creative and help Ferrero to produce superior chocolates in the competitive market in which it operates.
• Ferrero motivates employees financially by paying a competitive wage. This is important to retain and attract the best people in the industry.
• Motivated employees feel valued and part of a team. Ferrero asks employees for suggestions as well as analysing employee feedback. This should improve productivity at Ferrero.
• However, methods of motivating employees can be costly. Providing extensive training programmes and attractive wages will increase the costs for Ferrero. This may push up prices of its products which may result in loss of competitiveness.
• Ferrero asks all employees to act like entrepreneurs and provide suggestions for improvement. Highly trained and motivated employees may leave the business and work for competitors once trained, which will increase the recruitment costs.",,,,4,TRUE,11

• Segmentation is dividing the market into groups of people with similar attributes or common characteristics.
• The global chocolate market is segmented in a number of ways such as type of chocolate, sale frequency, organic and seasonal chocolates.
• segmentation increases costs. When a company attempts to serve different groups of customers the cost of production rises as well as research, promotional and distribution costs.
• By focusing on providing niche chocolates there is a danger that this specialisation could lead to problems if consumers change their purchasing habits significantly.
• The market segments identified may be too small, e.g. organic chocolate, and may not generate sufficient sales to be viable/profitable for the business.
 Focusing on specific market segments allows a company such as
 Ferrero to analyse segments of the markets and tailor products to
 meet the particular needs of those customers.
 Market segmentation helps to direct advertising and promotion to
 specific groups of customers, e.g. those looking for health benefits,
 and therefore help to make marketing more effective.
 Market segmentation can help chocolate suppliers to identify
 underserved customers, such as those seeking organic and fair-trade
 chocolate, which provide the opportunity to increase sales.
 It helps a company to focus on the most profitable and productive
 segments of the market to increase revenue and profitability.",,,,5,TRUE,11

• Part-time employees generally work a few hours or a few days a week.
•
 Temporary work is generally for a limited period of time.
 Kapgel uses part-time and temporary employees to deliver goods to
 customers in Istanbul.
• A benefit of using part-time employees is that it provides flexibility to the business as staff can be scheduled at the busiest times of the day to meet customer demand and deliver goods on time to customers.
• A major benefit of using temporary employees is lower costs. Often temporary employees receive fewer or no benefits compared to permanent staff, depending on their contract. The lack of benefits saves money for the business which can be used elsewhere to grow the business.
• Using part-time employees may attract staff who have other commitments and do not wish to work on a full-time basis. This may improve the work life balance of staff and result in motivated and productive staff.
 • However,  temporary employees, may have less knowledge and familiarity with the company. This can affect employee performance
 and impact the efficiency of the delivery service.
• Recruitment costs may be higher if a business has a more flexible workforce as the turnover of staff may be high. This may reduce Kapgel’s profit margins.
• Some employees prefer full-time employment and a permanent contract. This may lead to a lack of commitment by workers at Kapgel. This may lead to Kapgel losing workers to competitors and facing disruption to customer service.",,,,9,TRUE,11

•
• Product range may be an important element in the delivery market.
•
•
• However, other aspects of the marketing mix: place, price and promotion are equally as important to the success of the delivery businesses.
•
•
• Due to the intense competition in Turkey, delivery businesses must stand out in the market and ensure they are using promotional methods suited to the audience.
• The distribution of the goods may also be important to consumers. Kapgel deliver in one hour but Getir, who have warehouses located around Istanbul, are able to delivery to customers in under ten minutes. If speed of delivery is important to consumers’ then place will be an important element of the marketing mix.
• Whilst product is crucial to the success of the delivery services, all elements of the marketing mix are equally importance to ensure the business succeeds in the long term.
 Product is one element of the marketing mix. The other three
 elements are place (distribution), promotion and price.
 Getir stock 1,000 different products in its warehouses. Kapgel do not
 keep stock and allow the customer to shop from a wide range of
 shops.
 This may influence demand for the businesses if consumers are
 looking for a wider variety of goods.
 Tap water in Turkey is not drinkable, therefore the product of clean
 water is crucial to the success of BiSu.
 Price may be an important element due to the competition in the on-
 demand market. Increased numbers of people are using the delivery
 services in Istanbul and therefore suppliers may need to compete on
 price to survive.
 Deliveries are made within one hour by Kapgel for a delivery fee of 5
 Turkish Lira. Getir add a cost to each product and has a minimum
 shopping total of 15 Turkish Lira before it will deliver an order. Price
 may be an important element for some consumers resulting in
 reduced revenue for Getir.",,,,10,TRUE,11

• Cost efficiency aims to minimise the costs of producing goods and services.
• TOMS is experiencing increasing costs and low profit margins. Due to financial problems in 2014 it was given a $313m investment from a private company but growth and profit margins remain lower than expected.
• Reducing its costs may be important to increase its profit margins. Profits are important to TOMS to enable it to reinvest into the growth of the company and develop its portfolio.
• Reducing costs and increasing profit margins are also necessary to keep its investors satisfied. TOMS may fail to attract further private investors if returns are low.
• Reducing material costs of the shoes may help the company to sell at a lower price and compete with companies such as Skechers that are selling a similar style shoe at half the price.
• However, reducing the costs may impact the quality of the shoes. If TOMS use an inferior quality of material or less responsible suppliers it may lose its brand identity.
Social objectives
• •
•
Social objectives are a company’s goals and commitment to manage the impact of its operations on others. This is also referred to as corporate social responsibility.
help to improve the public image of the company. This shows consumers that the business is
going above and beyond to help the society in which it operates and may lead to higher levels of revenue for TOMS.
 TOMS donate a pair of shoes for every pair it sells. For some
 customers, the social goals and practices of a company are
 important which may increase sales and encourage repeat
 purchase for TOMS.
 Helping to improve eyesight should
• Pursuing social objectives may lead to increased media coverage for TOMS and increased demand.
• A benefit of focussing on social goals is the possibility of attracting new investors. If the social goals align with an investor’s view, they may be more inclined to invest in a company.
• Likewise, employees who share the same social goals of the company will be more motivated at work when they know the company is working toward the same objectives.
 
• However, social objectives can increase the costs for the company. The one-for-one policy and helping improve eyesight is an expensive commitment.
• Also using sustainable and re-cyclable materials pushes up costs and prices of goods. If price is an important factor for consumers, they are likely to buy from rivals such as Skechers.
• Other factors may also be important to its survival such as widening its portfolio. The portfolio of products is small and since it was founded in 2006, the company has done little to expand beyond its basic style of shoe.
• Overall it is likely that cost efficiency is important to TOMS in order to survive financially. It may need to reduce costs and increase its profitability if it is to survive long term.
• However, the USP of TOMS is its ethical behaviour and its pursuit of social objectives. If this is compromised, then TOMS may lose its means of differentiation and not survive in the long term.",,,,12,TRUE,11
